                <br />
                <br />
                Starting as a creative project,  this homegrown zine is dedicated as a small outlet for up-and-coming people, places, stories around LDN. As a student, this is just my way of starting something meaningful in our community.
                <br />
                <br />
                With all that's going on in the world, it's important to be reminded of the spirit of our local community, while trying to also make a difference from the position we're in. So spread that love, donate to Medical Aid for Palestinians, and try to do something.
                <br />

                safe,
